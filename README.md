# RayTracer-Java

This is a from-scratch project written in Java using Eclipse that utilizes Ray Tracing Technology.

## How to Run
Running the main method in RayTracer, the application can take in a scene file (see examples in [Models and Scenes](/Models\ and\ Scenes)) and `.obj`/`.mat` polygonal files, and will output a `.ppm` image according to the specifications.

Another way of running the application would be without arguments, in which case it will generate spheres in an evironmnet and output a file named `masterwork.ppm`.
